## Surface
I have taken on inspiration from sites such as Linden Tree Ranch and Markfield equestrian centre. I want to provide a website that is very
clean by utilizing whitespace and strong typography to make it inviting to the user and to make content easily readable. 

**Colours**
White space has been used to provide a sense of calm, I have also utilised a golden sand colour (#fafafa) within the logo and footer. 
This has been used to tie in with the sand in the arena of the riding school and also provides an upmarket feel to the site and brand. 

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make it clearly visible to the user against the white background.
