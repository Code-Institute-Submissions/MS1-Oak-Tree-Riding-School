### Skeleton
![Wireframes preview](wireframespreview.jpg)

Wireframes have been created using a mobile first approach. 
Please [click here](wireframesdesktopandmobile.pdf) to view the PDF showing full wireframes for the site. 



### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from sites such as Linden Tree Ranch and Markfield equestrian centre. I want to provide a website that is very
clean by utilizing whitespace and strong typography to make it inviting to the user and to make content easily readable. 

**Colours**

White space has been used to provide a sense of calm, I have also utilised a golden sand colour (#fafafa) within the logo and footer. 
This has been used to tie in with the sand in the arena of the riding school and also provides an upmarket feel to the site and brand. 

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Lora has been used for headings - this font has been selected to provide an upmarket feel to the branding.

**Body text**

 Hind Madurai has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user and contrasts nicely against the heading and navigation font of Lora.

**Photography**

Photography is one of the important elements on the site, bright and calming images have been used to create a sense of relaxation to the user and 
to tie in with the simple color palette.

## Problems and solutions 

### Design

1. In my wireframes I had opted to have the logo to the top left of the page. I felt 
that this resulted in it getting lost within the whitespace. I decided to make the design
decision to center this. I felt it created more of an impact on both desktop and mobile
views.

### Navigation bar

1. The Navbar menu background was going transparent when toggling on mobile view. This was fixed by using Chrome dev tools to select the class and override the Bootstrap styling.

2. When using the fixed navbar the main Logo was covered this was fixed by adding margin top in the CSS.

### Page aesthetics
1. Headers of the site were masked by the navigation bar when clicking different links of the site - margin top was 
added to each section to ensure that headers could be viewed and weren't masked by the header bar.

2. On mobile view the instructors section images weren't centered correctly. This was fixed by adding divs around the images with a text-center property.
Left and right padding was also added to the text within the instructors section to improve the page aesthetics in mobile view.

3. Overflow - when testing the website on mobile devices there was unwanted horizontal overflow. Chrome DevTools was used to determine which element
was causing the overflow. This was found to be within the instructors section. This error was found to be caused within the row inline styling was used to
correct it. Testing was then carried out using Chrome DevTools and Responsinator as well as testing on a Google Pixel 3a mobile device. Further testing ensured
that the overflow problem has been solved. 

### Functionality
1. The social media links were displaying a 404. This was fixed by updating the link and including https:// in the link address. 

2. The contact form was missing the required element - this was added so the form couldn't be
submitted without entries. 

3. The social media icons were missing span elements - this would be added
to enable functionality for users that require screen readers. 

### CSS validation
1. When using the (Jigsaw)[https://jigsaw.w3.org/] CSS validator the following errors arose.
![Parse errors](assets/images/parsedebug.png)
These were debugged and then the code was tested again using direct input where it was free of errors.

1. Log in to Github and locate the websites repository.
2. Under the repository name click on settings on the top right of the menu.
3. Under the source section select the dropdown 'None' and Master branch.
4. The page will automatically refresh.

## Credits

Inspiration has been taken from the following websites




- [Linden Tree Retreat and Ranch](https://www.lindenretreat.com/)

![Linden Tree Retreat preview](assets/images/lindenpreview.jpg)

I really like the use of whitespace and focus on strong imagery
and typography. I felt like this was something I wanted to utilize within my own project. 

- [Markfield Equestrian Centre](https://www.mecweb.co.uk/) 

![Markfield preview](assets/images/markfieldpreview.jpg)

I feel like this riding school website has a good structure for prospective clients to gain information on the riding school with ease. I wanted to emulate this 
within my project. I was particuarly inspired by the layout of the horses section and this has led me to the use bootstrap cards within this section to provide clear concise information
on horses at the riding school.
